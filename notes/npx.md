When you run:

bash
Copy
Edit
npx some-tool
Hereâ€™s how it decides what to run:

Looks in your local node_modules/.bin/
If it's already installed locally, it uses that.

If not found, it downloads from npm into a temp cache

Installs the latest version (unless you specify one)

Caches it in your user directory

Then runs it

Does not install it into your package.json

ðŸ—‚ Where Does It Store Stuff?
Cached downloads go into:

arduino
Copy
Edit
~/.npm/_npx/<random-hash>/
(or %AppData%\npm-cache on Windows)

These are temporary â€” they get cleaned over time
